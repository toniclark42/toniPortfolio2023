            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a Frontend Engineer, I have worked in building and maintaining UI's both large and small in React and Vue. While working in frontend, I have gained a passion for Accessibility and refactored projects to improve their scores. More importantly, I audited the sites and made them available to those that needed to use them by either tabbing through or using a screen reader.</p>
            <p>I started my tech career by teaching code to young adults in both corporate and high school settings. Since then, I have continued to volunteer with these individuals with no tech experience to help them start their careers in the tech world.</p>
